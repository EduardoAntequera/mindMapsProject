The database contains some testing data. The project needs the driver for sqlite3 to connect to the database, it can be downloaded here https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/sqlite-jdbc-driver/
then, you must add the driver's .jar file path in Eclipse or Intellij.
Once this has been done running the main.java file should work correctly.
